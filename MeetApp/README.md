# Differences:
- We ended up setting up and adding the login/registration logic through Firebase which was not originally in our goals for the alpha.
- Other than this, we met all of our goals besides implementing the meeting/event functionality and navigation with MapKit. However, multiple of us have begun the research and development process with MapKit already to be prepared to complete it during the initial working time of beta.
